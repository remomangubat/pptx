# Exploring Career Opportunities in Tech  
for Informatics Students

- Guest Speaker: [Your Name]
- Audience: College seniors
- Goal: Clarity on roles, skills, and actionable next steps

<!-- Presenter notes:
Set expectations: practical, honest, and action-oriented. Encourage questions throughout and note there’s a dedicated Q&A near the end.
-->

---

# Self Introduction

- [Your Name] — [Your current role/title]
- Focus areas: [e.g., software engineering, product, data, cloud/devops]
- Experience: [X years], projects across [industries/domains]
- Fun facts: [teaching/mentoring, OSS contributions, interests]
- Contact: [email] • [LinkedIn] • [GitHub]

<!-- Presenter notes:
Briefly establish credibility and relevance to Informatics. Keep it friendly; share one human detail to connect.
-->

---

# Personal Story: Starting Out

- First steps: [internship/bootcamp/self-taught/college projects]
- Early challenges: “no experience” loop, rejection, overwhelm
- Breakthroughs: small wins, mentors, shipping real features
- Lessons learned:
  - Curiosity > credentials
  - Ship > perfect
  - Feedback > assumptions

<!-- Presenter notes:
Share 1–2 concrete anecdotes (first internship/app, a tough bug, first PR). Emphasize progress over perfection and learning in public.
-->

# The Tech Landscape (You Have Options)

- Build & Ship
  - Frontend (Web/SPA), Backend (APIs), Mobile (iOS/Android), Full‑stack
  - QA/SDET (automation), DevOps/SRE (CI/CD, reliability)
- Data & Intelligence
  - Data Engineering (pipelines), Analytics, Data Science/ML, MLOps
- Experience & Product
  - UI/UX (research, design, prototyping), Product Owner/Manager, BA
- Platforms & Security
  - Cloud/Infra, IT Support, IT/SecOps, AppSec, GRC
- Enablement
  - Developer Relations, Technical Writing, Solutions/Pre‑Sales
- Paths blend: T‑shaped people thrive

<!-- Presenter notes:
Give a one‑liner for each role and typical stack/tools. Encourage exploration via internships, projects, and electives. Emphasize overlap and mobility across roles.
-->

# Skill‑First Mindset

- Master fundamentals
  - CS basics: data structures, algorithms, networking, DBs
  - Web basics: HTTP, REST, HTML/CSS/JS, Git
- Build your T‑shape
  - One depth (e.g., frontend) + broad literacy across adjacent areas
- Output over claims
  - “What can you build?” > “What do you know?”
  - Demos, repos, write‑ups, small shipped features
- Feedback loops
  - Code reviews, user testing, mentorship, postmortems
- Learn in public
  - Notes, blogs, PRs, talks — show your process

<!-- Presenter notes:
Tie skills to visible artifacts. Highlight that explaining work (docs, readmes) is a differentiator. Mention consistent habits beat cramming.
-->

---

# Entry‑Level Challenges

- Job posts: “Entry‑level (2–3 yrs exp)” paradox
- ATS filters and noisy markets
- Imposter syndrome and comparison trap
- Local constraints: fewer roles, broad responsibilities
- Reality check:
  - It’s a funnel — but there are many doors
  - You can influence signal: projects, referrals, narrative

<!-- Presenter notes:
Normalize rejection. The strategy is to increase signal and surface area: tailored apps, referrals, visible work, and persistence.
-->

---

# What To Do (Concrete Actions)

- Portfolio (3–5 strong pieces)
  - Real problems, live demo, clean README, tests, screenshots
  - Show breadth + 1 depth; measure impact (perf, users, metrics)
- Freelance & internships
  - Small paid gigs, campus orgs, NGOs, startups — real users, deadlines
- Open Source
  - “good first issue,” docs, tests, small bugfixes → then features
  - Be coachable: follow CONTRIBUTING, respond to review
- Continuous learning
  - Roadmaps/track plans, 1 cert (only if relevant), weekly practice
- Network, the right way
  - Share work, ask for feedback, help others, attend meetups
- Apply smart
  - Tailored resume, simple portfolio site, targeted roles, referrals

<!-- Presenter notes:
Offer examples: clone + extend a popular app; contribute to a library you use; write a postmortem on a bug you fixed. Show that small consistent steps compound.
-->

---

# Q&A

- Ask about roles, projects, portfolios, interviews, learning paths
- No “perfect path” — there’s a good next step for you

<!-- Presenter notes:
Invite specifics: “Tell me your target role; I’ll suggest a 60–90 day plan.” If quiet, seed with common questions (which stack to start with, how to get a first client, etc.).
-->

---

# End — Key Takeaways

- Pick a lane to start; keep breadth
- Build and show your work
- Learn in public; ask for feedback
- Relationships multiply opportunities
- Reach out: [email] • [LinkedIn] • [GitHub] • [QR to portfolio]

Thank you!

<!-- Presenter notes:
Close with encouragement and a clear next step: choose one project this week and ship a v1. Offer to review 1–2 portfolios after the talk if feasible.
